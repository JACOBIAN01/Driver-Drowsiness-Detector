# Driver Drowsiness Detection System ðŸš—ðŸ’¤

## Introduction  
Driver drowsiness is a major cause of accidents worldwide. This project uses Python and computer vision techniques to detect signs of drowsiness in drivers and alert them to prevent accidents. The system monitors facial features such as eyes and mouth to determine the driver's state.

## Features  
- Detects eye blinks and prolonged closure.  
- Monitors yawning as a sign of drowsiness.  
- Real-time video stream processing.  
- Alerts the driver with an alarm sound.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, Dlib, Scipy, Imutils  
- **Tools**: Haar Cascades, Facial Landmark Detection  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/driver-drowsiness-detection.git
   cd driver-drowsiness-detection
